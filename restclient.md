# Using RESTClient Firefox Plugin to Learn the RAX RESTful API

Command-line tools like [curl][curl] allow you to sent HTTP(S) requests to [Rackspace's Public Cloud API][api], in order to interact directly.  But why not also try [RESTClient][plugin], a Firefox plugin?

You can install the RESTClient plugin from [addons.mozilla.org][plugin].  Restart Firefox, and you'll see red icon with a circle appear.  
![RESTClient Icon][restclient-icon]
 
Click the icon to open RESTClient in a new tab.
